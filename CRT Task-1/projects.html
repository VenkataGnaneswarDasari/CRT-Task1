                <p>This is an virtual Internship programme provided by Andhra pradesh Government. In this internship we learnt about dealing with large amount of data.
                    For dealing with large amount of data we use a tool named Alterxy tool which is used to clean,filter,and organise the data.
                    This is one of the best tool to manipulate the large amount of data sets. This internship is not yet completed and we just completed the micro credential course.
